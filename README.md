# abstract-class-assignment

Ryan Williams Software Development I CEN-3024C-26663

This is a small Abstract Class demonstration from my COP 2800C Java course.

It prints values from four different instances of two different classes, SuperHero and SuperVillian. Both classes inherit the abstract class SuperHuman and they are required to overload the abstract methods usePower() and talk(). \n
There are no expected inputs. For each SuperHero, running the program should output the information about them, what happens when they "usePower()", and what they say when they "talk()".
